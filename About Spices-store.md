**NAMOH Spices** is a website designed to handle and manage user data for a spice store. 
Developed using the **MERN stack** 
(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), 
it provides a comprehensive platform for customers to browse and order spices,
while also facilitating contact and order management for the business.

 Key Features:
1. User Registration and Login**: Users can create accounts and log in to place orders, ensuring a personalized experience.
2. Product Catalog: A detailed listing of various spices, including descriptions, prices,
     and images. Users can browse through categories, search for specific items, and add them to their cart.
3. Order Management: Customers can place orders, which are stored in a database, and track their order status.
     The business owner can view and manage these orders through a simple admin interface.
4. Contact Form: A feature for customers to send inquiries or feedback directly to the store, improving communication between the business and its users.
5. Database: MongoDB stores user information, orders, and product details.
     It ensures that the data is scalable and easily retrievable for both the frontend and backend.

Technologies Used:
- React.js for the front-end, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend, handling API requests and server-side logic.
- MongoDB for storing data related to products, users, and orders.

The project aims to streamline the process of managing an online spice store, making it efficient for both customers and business owners.
It also serves as a practical application of MERN stack technologies, offering valuable hands-on experience in full-stack development.
